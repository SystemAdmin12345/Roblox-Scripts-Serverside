# Roblox Script
 
Important notes:
This only works in roblox, it does not work anywhere else.
Those are "server sided" scripts that require server side access. Exploiting will do NOTHING at all. To execute those scripts, go to a "require script executor" game and you can execute those scripts (some scripts might be NSFW so please don't use them)
If your game ever freezes, open task manager or activity monitor depending on your os and then kill the "Roblox" process.
Use at your own risk, I am not responsible for any bans caused by the scripts in this repository.

This contains Roblox ServerSide script, Do not confuse it with FE scripts. Roblox ServerSide scripts can be executed in Roblox script executor games.
Note: Some scripts may cause roblox to crash but it will not affect anything outside Roblox. If you notice lag, go to task manager then kill Roblox.
Also, make sure to replace "Your Username" with your username ("" required)
Eg: require(something):fire("Player1")
